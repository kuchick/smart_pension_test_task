# Implementation
Approach is to go line by line and fill array with ip visits for each path

What is done:
- Splitting logic to separate classes (S in SOLID).
- Validations (file permissions, existence, non-empty, path without ip in log line)
- rubocop: `no offenses detected`
- DI usage
- Error logging

What can be done:
- IP validation
- To reduce memory usage it can make sense to store not full ip visits list for each path, but count of visits for each ip like:
```{'/about' => { '111.222.333.444' => 1, '222.333.444.555' => 6 }}```.
But in real life data is stored in database, so my implementation is simple enough and can be not efficient for big log files
- Repo doesn't have tests because I've reached 2.5h time limit ğŸ˜…
